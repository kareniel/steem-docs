### Oh ohh, there isn't an entry for this term yet! 

[Steemdocs](https://github.com/steemdocs/steemdocs) is a project that aims to build the equivalent of MDN for the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md). The goal of SteemDocs.net is to be a one-stop shop for all Steem developers.

Steemdocs is fully open-sourced and powered by the utopian.io project. This means that you can get rewarded by helping SteemDocs become the most valuable resource for Steem developers.
