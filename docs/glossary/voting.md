# Voting

Core to the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) logic is the action of **voting**. There are 2 types of votes on the network:

- Vote for [witnesses](/glossary/witness.md) to be [block](/glossary/block.md) producers / validators
- Vote for content

The fundamental unit of account on the Steem platform is [STEEM](/glossary/steem.md), a cryptocurrency token. Steem operates on the basis of one-STEEM, one-vote. Under this model, individuals who have the higest [STEEM Power](/glossary/steem-power.md) in their account, have the most influence over how contributions are scored and which witnesses becomes approved by the community.

## Voting Token Rewards

Token rewards are distributed by the amount of [rshares](/glossary/reward-shares.md) backing a given article. Authors are given the option to receive rewards in STEEM Power or split the reward between STEEM Power and STEEM Dollar (50% each). How much is distributed is dictated by the token's [reward curve](/glossary/reward-curve.md), [reward pool](/glossary/reward-pool.md), [price feed](/glossary/steem-price-feed.md) and how many people are competing for it.

## Upvotes & Downvotes

When content is published by [authors](/glossary/author.md) it is then available for applications to be display on their website. Users ([curators](/glossary/curator.md) in this context) can upvote or downvote(also known as flagging) depending on whether they appreciate the content or find it abusive (spam, plagiarized content, etc.)

## Voting Authority

This type of [transaction](/glossary/transaction.md) requires the user to enter their [private](/glossary/private-key.md) [posting key](/glossary/active-key.md) in order to be broadcasted.
