# Contributing to the Steem Documentation Network

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1::tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to **Steem Documentation Network**, which is hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Please read these instructions before submitting issues to the **SDN** GitHub repository. The issue tracker is for bugs and specific implementation discussion **only**. It should not be used for other purposes, as described below.

## Looking For Something To Do?

We have a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ykV4TGZ3/steem-documentation-network) with all the tasks that we are looking to accomplish or build. Make sure to read through the instruction in the "Meta" box before getting started with your task. Do not create a card that you don't intend on working on yourself.

## Bug Reports

If there is an existing feature that is not working correctly, or a glitch that is impacting users - please open an issue to report variance. Include as much relevant information as you can, including screen shots or log output when applicable, and steps to reproduce the issue.

## Implementation Discussion

The developers frequently open issues to discuss changes that are being worked on. This is to inform the community of the changes being worked on, and to get input from the community and other developers on the implementation.

Issues opened that devolve into lengthy discussion of minor site features will be closed or locked.  The issue tracker is not a general purpose discussion forum.

This is not the place to make suggestions for product improvement. **If you are not planning to work on the change yourself - do not open an issue for it.**

## Duplicate Issues

Please do a keyword search to see if there is already an existing issue before opening a new one.

## Pull Requests

Anybody in the community is welcome and encouraged to submit pull requests with any desired changes to the platform!

Requests to make changes that include working, tested pull requests jump to the top of the queue. There is not a guarantee that all functionality submitted as a PR will be accepted and merged, however.
